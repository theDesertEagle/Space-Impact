## Introduction
Inspired by Nokia's old cell-phone classic game, 'Space-Impact: The Lone Survivor' is an endless-based 2D space-shooter game, designed to function on any computer-supported web-browser by playing around with the DOM elements using the Phaser.js Framework. In the game, the player flys a spaceship in a distant galaxy to eliminate incoming swarm of enemies, which increase in number with time. The spacehsip's ammo is limited and gets replenished by one rocket as and when an enemy is destroyed. The video-game was locally tested using ngrok.  

Note: As per Google's Autoplay Policy 2018, the player would have to click on the screen once to begin the background music if he/she is using Google Chrome. This does not apply for other web-broswers respectively. 

## Software Tools
Being a complete front-end application, the game relies on the following technologies:
- Adobe Photoshop, to create almost all of the 2D game assets
- Audacity, for simple audio-editing
- HTML5, for laying the foundation of the application
- CSS, for styling the controls and adjusting the placement of landing screens
- Vanilla JS, for handling audio control
- JQuery, for quickly rendering the instructions page and switching between graphic modes
- Phaser JS, for seamlessly handling the animations and game-physics of DOM elements
- Ngrok, for web-browser game-testing

## Quick Instructions
1. Press F11 to go Full Screen Mode once you arrive at the game's landing page.
2. After pressing the 'START GAME' button, choose the graphics-rendering mode for the game. The available options are:
   - Canvas Mode: The default option; Uses HTML Canvas to render graphics on the browser
   - WebGL Mode: Uses this Javascript API for faster gaming performance
3. Understand the control-style for the game, and continue to the game by pressing 'GOT IT' button.

6. It is crucial to understand the peculiar characteristics of your enemies.
   - Minions are green-spaceships that tend to slide towards you very quickly.
   - Spiders are slower red-spaceships which fire special types of bullets in your direction. These bullets dynamically orient themselves midway to so that they do not miss you.
   - Rockets, as the name suggests, are the fastest indestructible enemy-spaceships that rush towards you in a blink of an eye. Shooting them bags in additional score points.

7. The enemies tend to spawn slowly initially from the left section of the screen, but later on the player has to deal with a swarm of enemies gushing towards him/her.

8. While you're at it, try and discover embedded cheat-codes in the game. A cheat-code is a 3-letter or 2-letter sequence, which when pressed simultaneously gives the player any one of these power-ups:
   - Immortality (God) or Mortality
   - 100+ Ammunition
   - 100+ Score
   - Faster, Slower or Normal Locomotion
9. If enemy-swarm sweeps away all of your three lives, press F5 to restart the game.

## Future Works
1. Addition of more levels for prolonged gaming experience.
2. Addition of more power-ups for stronger resistance against the swarm of enemies 
3. Addition of small-screen adaptability and controls for mobile compatibility
